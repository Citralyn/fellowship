# Fellowship

This is the website for the ICS Student Council Fellowship.  

The goal of the Fellowship is to teach fundamental software development and web development skills that arenâ€™t normally taught in the classroom. 
By the end of the quarter, students will have the skillset necessary to create their own React websites and will have the opportunity to contribute to one our ICSSC Projects such as [AntAlmanac](https://antalmanac.com), [PeterPortal](http://peterportal.org), or [Zotistics](http://zotistics.com)!

## Contributing
All of our content can be found under the `/docs` directory. Each unit is written in Markdown, so it is easy for any to contribute.
